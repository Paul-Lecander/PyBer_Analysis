# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this project was to create a DataFrame summary with ride-sharing data from different types of cities.

## Results:

After the PyBer data was analyzed and put into new dataframes, the results from each city type can be shown here:

- This dataframe shows that the Urban city type has 13 times more total rides than Rural and approximately 31 times more drivers.
- It should also be noted that both Rural and Suburban city types have more total ride than drivers, while Urban is the only city type with more drivers than total rides.
- Urban city types have the lowest average ride fare and lowest average driver fare.

## Summary:
Based on the data, there are a few recommendations to the CEO that could be made:
- The number of drivers in the Urban areas could be limited to increase the average fare per driver, that would raise the drivers pay but limit the number of total drivers.
- To incentivize drivers in the Rural area, a higher percentage of the total fare could go to the driver.
- Since the average fare for rides in the Urban areas are vastly lower than the Rural area, a portion of the total fare could subsidize some fees paid by Rural riders.
